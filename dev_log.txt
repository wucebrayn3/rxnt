I used Django for backend
I used CRA for frontend

pip install... (while venv is active)
...django
...djangorestframework
...channels
...channels_redis

configured the settings.py to contain ASGI_APPLICATION

project name is: rxnt

inside backend folder, and inside the project folder, there's a folder for the app: rxnt_api

went to frontend dir and installed axios

For my django models (CRUD will be used, ofc),

these will be my core models:

Posting
-user
-content
-timestamp

Messaging
-sender
-receiver
-content
-timestamp

User
-username
-password

I tried to run makemigrations but encountered an error with corsheaders

fix:
attempt 1: pip install django-cors-headers
result: successful

ran migrate

Next is registering the models in admin

created superuser
samuel
samcv090505

installed postman for testing

finished the frontend sample, ready for testing

need to further study abt the files and codes inside
